# Portal eclipse data analysis

This project includes scripts to visualize freeway station data in Portal.
We wanted to explore how the solar eclipse on 8/21/17 affected traffic patterns, specifically, what speed-flow diagrams looked like.


Portal is the regional transportation data archive in the Portland-Vancouver metro region.

[Speed-flow diagrams](https://www.google.com/search?q=traffic+speed+flow+curves)

Data are analyzed in Wilsonville, close to the I-5 Boone Bridge and I-5 Wilsonville freeway interchange. 
This is the southern-most point in the metro region available from Portal "stations" data".

# Scripts
* volume_speed_plots.R - make volume-speed plots for eclipse traffic
* animate_volume_speed_plot.R - animate the volume-speed plot by hour on the day of the eclipse
